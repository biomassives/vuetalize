    <h1>About Eco Ops App</h1>

    <p>
      Eco Ops is a project of <a href="https://scdhub.org">SCD Hub</a>, a US 501c3 non profit

      Community level verification rather than external agents lower costs and lower the bar for
      participation. Participants are trained to be experts in proven techniques most appropriate
      for their regional context.
      <br />
      <br />
      Eco Ops' primary effort is to track and verify biodiversity credit-worthy activities, so they
      are transparent, effective and to empower those most effected by pollution, climate change and
      associated ecosystem decline. Proper efforts can turn this around.

      <br />
      Waste management problems have solutions - upstream producer responsibility, recycling and
      composting, upcycling and development of circular ecomonies where ecomonic empowerment is
      needed the most.
      <br />
      <br />
      Eco Ops works relyies on participant checkins and peer review. Photos, video recording, and
      details about steps taken toward achieving milestones
